So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when s?ddenly a White Rabbit with vink eyes ran close by her.Th?re was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!¡¯ (whe? she thought it over afterwyrds, it occurred to her that?she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the ?abbit actually took a watch&out of its waistcoat-pockt,?and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had8never before seen a rabbit w?th either a waistcoat-pocket? or a watch to take out??f i, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pip down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another mo?ent down went Alice after it, nev?r once considering how in the world she was to get out a?a	n.The rabbit-hole we?t str?i?ht on `?ke a tunnel8for s?m} ?ay, a?d then dippe? sude?n?y down,??o sudenly that Alice had n?t a moment to think abou??p¤§?pping herself before she¨¤¤Æou¤Îd herself falling do?n y ve?y deep well.Either t?e w?m? ¤×as very deep, or she fel??F?r? slowly, for she had p?eo?y?of time as she went dowc??? look about her and to w???¡±?¥à?hat was going to h?ppen??e??.
