So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the ?ay to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! ? shall be late!¡¯ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, an fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went st?aight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped sud?enly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself befos? she found herself falling down a very deep well.Either ?he well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, s?e tri?d to look down and make out!?hat she was coming to? but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed thyt they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps gnd pictures hung upon pegs. ?he&took down a jar from one!?f ?he shelves as she passed; i? w?s labelled ¡®ORANGE MARMALAD?¡¯, but to her great disappl?ntment it was empty: she ¡µd?not like to drop the jar ?¤Ò?fear of killing somebody,??? managed to put it into one#of the cupboards as she fe?past it.¡®Well!¡¯ thought Ali?e to herself, ¡®after such ?&fall as this, I shall think ??¤Ôhing of tumbling down stai??!
