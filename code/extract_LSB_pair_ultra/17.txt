So she was con?idering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the k?t |ay made her feel very sleep?and stupid), whether the pl?asure of making a daisy-chai¤Î would be worth the trouble ?f getting up and pickind?th? daisies, when suddenly?a Whiu? Rabbit with pink ey}s ran `lose by her.There was?nothing so very remarkable in that8 nor did Alice think it so v?ry much out of the way to he?r the Rabbit say to itself,?¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall c? late!¡¯ (when she u?ought it over afterwards, it occurred?to her that she ou??t to hav? wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed¨¤quite natural); but when ?he Rabbit#actually took a wgtch out of its waistcoat-poc?e?? and looked at it, and t?en hurried on, Alice startee?to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it,?and burning with curiosity,&she ran aross the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under!?he hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the?world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went straight oh like a tunnel for ?ome way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself ?efore she found herself falm?ng down a very deep well.Either the well was very deep, ?r ¤Óe fell very slowly, for8she?had plenty of ime as sh? went down to look about her a?d?to wonder what was going t???appen next. First, she?tr	?d to look down and make!?ut?what she was coming to, but,?t was too dark to see anythi¤Î?; then sh? looked at the s¤Édes of!?he8¤×ell, and notice? ?hat they were filled with&cupbomr?s and book-shelves; ???e ad?there she saw maps g?? piotures hung upon pegs.
