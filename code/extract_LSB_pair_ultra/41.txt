So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-c?ain would be worth the trouzle of getting up and picking?the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!¡¯ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought ?o have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went strai??t on like a tunnel for some&way, and hen dipped suddenl? e?wn, so suddenly that Alice ?ad not a moment to think about stopping herself before sh found herself falling down&a very deep well.Either the well was very deep, or s?e g?ll very slowly, for she8had??lenty of time as she we?t go?n to look about her and to ¤×onder what was going to hapen next. First, she tr?ed to ¤Ìook down and make out what ?he was coming to, but?it wa? too dark to see anythi?g??hen she looked at the s?e?s?¤Ïf the well, and notice| thg? they were filled with cu?¤Árds and book-shelves; heB? ?nd there she saw maps ?n???ictures hung upon pegs.&Sh?&u?ok down a jar from one?of??he shelves as she passed; it?was labelled ¡®ORANGE MAR?ALAD?¡¯/?but to her great disgs?oint?ent it was empty: she e?d?no¤Ô like to drop the jar??r?fear of killing someb?e?, so managed to put it into o?e??f the cupboards as sh? ?¤Ål? past it.¡®Well!¡¯ thougi?
