So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a dais?-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and pick?ng the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.Thee ws nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!¡¯ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and thn hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had neer before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoau?pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with c?riosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, s? sudd?nly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep ell.Either the well w?s v?ry?dep, or she fell very slow?y, for she had plenty of time as she ent down to look a?out her and to wonder what Gas going to happen next. Fis?t, she tried to look down and make out what s?e was comi?g o, but it was&too dark ?o?see anything; then she look?d at the sides of the well,,and noticed that they were ¤Æ?lled with cupboards and boo??helves; here and there sh?saw maps and pictures huna8?pon pegs. She to?k down a j?r from one of th} shelves aC?¤Óhe passed; it was labelled ¡¯?RANGE MARMALADE¡¯, b?t t¤Ï,?er great disappointmeo? it8???8empty: she did!?ot like u??rop the jar for fear of ?io?io? somebody, so manyged ¡²o#??t it into one of the cu??oa?¤Äs as she fell past?it.¡®W?l¥á? thought Alice to ?erse?~, ??fter such a fall as t?i?,?I?shall think nothing lg?D?mbl?ng down stairs!
