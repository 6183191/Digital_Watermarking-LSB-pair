So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), wnether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when?uddenly a White Rabbit witi?pink eyes ran close by her.Tere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out ¤Ìf t?e way to hear the Rabbiu?say?to itself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh?ea?! I shall be late!¡¯ (whe? she thought it over afterwyrds? it occurred to her that?she ought to have wondered at tis, but at the time it all ?eemed quite natural); but wh?? the Rabbit actually to?k a watch out of its waistc¤Át-?cket, and looked at it, ?n? then hurried on, Alice par¤Ôed to her feet, for it flas?d across her mind that se ?ad never before seen a rabb?t with either a waistcoat-picet, or a watch to take o?t8?f it, and burning with c?rio@ity, she ran across the ?i?ld after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pp down a large rabbit-hol ?nder the hedge.In another mo?ent down went Alice after¨¤i?? never once considering h¤Ïw?	n the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole¨¤went straight on like a tunn?l??or some way, and then dipp?¨¤suddenly down, so sudden??8?at Alice had not a momen???l think about stopping he?self before she found hersel`???lling down a very deep wel??Either the well was very!?eep? or she fell very slow?y???¤Ïr she had plenty of time&as©@?he went down to look anou? ner and to wonder what was g¤Ãing to happen next.
