So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!¡¯ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.Either the well was very&deep, or she fell very slowl?, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, se tried to look down and make out what she was coming&to? but it was too dark to s?e?anything; then she looked!?? the sides of the well, and?noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-sh?lves; here and there she s??,?aps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar g??m one of the shelves as sh? p?ssed; it was labelled ¡®ORM?GE MARMALADE¡¯, but to her???ea disappointment it was&e???y: she did not like to d??p the jar for fear of ki?lon??Clmebody, so managed to put?it,into one of the cupboard? as she fell past it.¡®Wel?!¡¯&?h¤Ïught Alice to herself, ?at? such a fall as this,?O???a? think nothing of tum?l?bg?e?wn stairs!
