So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth tne trouble of getting up and p	ckin? the daisies, when suddenm? a Wi?te Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There wa? nothing so very remarkable in thgt; nor did Alice think it so?very much out of the w?y to hear the Rabbit say o!?tself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I shalm?be late!¡¯ (when ?he thought it over afterwars, it ccurs?d to her that she ougk? to have wondered at this, but!? the time it all seemed quite natural); but when ?he Rabbit actually took a wgtch out of its waistcoat-poc?et, and looked at it, and then hur?ied on, Alice started ti hes?feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and?burning with curiosity, she8ran across the f?eld after it, and fortuntem? ?as just in time to see ot pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after?it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole w¤Ånt straight on like a tunnel for some way, an?!?hen dipp?d suddenly down, ?o suddenly that Alice had ?ot a moment to think about stopping herself befor she found herself falling down a v?ry deep wel¤Ì.Either the well8w?s very deep, or she??e?? very8slowly,8for she ?ag ?lenty o? time as she went e??n to look about her and to?w??der what was going to hapv??next.
