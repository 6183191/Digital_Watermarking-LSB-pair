So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain?would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the?daisies, when sudden?y ? White Rabbit with p?nk eyes ran close by her.There was ?othing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say ?o its?lf, ¡®Oh ear! Oh dear9 I shall be late!¡¯ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have windered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a wa?ch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hu?ried on, Alice started to er feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never!?efore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately qas just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole uner he hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never?once considering how in the!?orld she was to get out again.The rbbit-hole went str?ight oh ¤Ìike a tunnel for some way, ?d then dipped su?denly dow?,?so suddenly that Alice had!?ot a moment to think a?out'??opping herself&be~ore she¨¤flund erself f?l?in? down a??ry deep well.Either the well wa very de?p, or she fe?? ¤Ö?ry slowly,8for she had p????y of time a? she went doqn?¤Ôo look about her and to w????r what was going to happ?¤Î!?ext.
