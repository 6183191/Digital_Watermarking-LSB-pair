So she was considering in her own mind (as wll as she could, for?the hot da made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain wold be worth the trouble o` getting up and picking the daisies, when su?denly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I ?hall be late!¡¯ (when ?he thought it over afterware?, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at th?s, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field???er8it, and fortunately wa8?ust?in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole unde~?t?e hedge.In another momen??down went Alice after it, o?ver once considering how in t?e world she was to get ou?again.The rabbit-hole went¨¤?trant on like a tunnel for so?e&wy, and then dipped C??????y down, so suddenly tha???`?c¤Å had not a moment to t?ink?about stopping herself!?}?¤Ïr??she found herself fal?ii? ?iwn a very deep well.Eiu??r?¡³?e well was very deep,??>¤Ó?¨¤ell very slowly, for he¥ãh¤Íd?plenty of time as ne Ae?? ?own to look about he???n? ? wonder what was going?t?!?¤Áppen next.

However, on the second time round, she ?ame upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down an? looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
