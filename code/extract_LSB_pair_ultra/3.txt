So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothig so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the w?y to hear the Rabbit say to!?tself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!¡¯ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when?the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-po?ket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field a?ter it, and `ortunately was8just in time to see it pop d?wn a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.Either the well was very deep? or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty o` time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and ?ake out what she was coming!?o, but it was too dark to see?anything; then she lok?d at the sides of the well,&and ?oticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the selves a she passed; it was labelled ¡®ORANGE MARMALADE¡¯, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like ti drop the jar for fear of killing someboe?, so managed to put it into one of the cupbards as she ?ell past it.¡®Well!¡¯ thou?ht Glice to herself, ¡®after&such?a fall a this, I shall?thio? nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they¡¯ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn¡¯t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!¡¯ (Which was very likely true.)Down, down, down.?Would the fall never come to an end! ¡®I wonder how many miles I¡¯ve fallen by this time?¡¯ she said aloud. ¡®I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand m?l?s diwn? I think¡ª¡¯ (for, you8?ee, Alice had learnt sever¤Á?¨¤things of this sort in he????ssns in the schoolroom,??nd though?this was not a VER? ?ood opportunity for showi??&off her?knowledge, as the????as ?o one t? listen to he~?#stim? it was good?practic???o say it over) ¡®¡ªyes, tha??¤Ó?¤Ábot the right distance¡ª??t?then I wonder what Latit?d??or Longitude I¡¯ve got to????¤¡?ice had no idea what LaD?tu?e was, or Longitude eitheB? but thought they were nic?!?s?n? words to say.)Presento?8?he began again. ¡®I wonde?#o?¨¤I?shall fall right throu??8t?e?earth!
