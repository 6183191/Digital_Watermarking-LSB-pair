So she was cnsidering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and pickig the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to 	tself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!¡¯ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ouht to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never?before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch o take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she rn across the fie?d aft?r&it, and fortunately8was just in time to see it p?p down a large rabbit-hole under the edge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out ag?in?The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.Either the well was very deep, or ¤ß?e#fell ?ery slowly, for she??a¤Ä plenty of time as she went ?own ?o look about her ao?????wonder what was going to??mppen next.
