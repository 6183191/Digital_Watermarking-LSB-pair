So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There Gas nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way8to hear the Rabbit say to it?elf, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I snall be late!¡¯ (when she thoug?t it over afterwards, it ocurred to her that she ought ?o have wondered at this, bu? at the time it all seemed qite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, ¤Ánd looked at it,8and then hurried on, Alice s?arted to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, ?nd burning with cu?iosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was#just in time to see it pop diwn?a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment?down went Alice after it, ne?er once considering how in the world she was to get out ?gain.The rabbit-hole went su?a??ht on like a tunnel for som? way, and then dipped sud?e??y dow, so suddenly that??oice had not a moment to ti?n??about stopping herself befor? she found herself falling ?¤Ïwn a very deep well.Either??he well was very deep, or h? fell very slowly, for she??ad q?e?ty of time as she Ge¤Ît down to look about her gn? to wonder what was going tl happe? next.
