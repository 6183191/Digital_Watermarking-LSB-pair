So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit ?ith pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothing so very?remarkable in that; nor did&Alice think it so very much ?ut of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!¡¯ ?when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went stra?ght on like a ?unnel for som¤Å way, and theo?dipped suddely down, so suddenly that Am?ce had not a m?ment to think about stoppin herself before she found he?self falling?down a very deep well.Either the well was ver?&deep, or ¤Ó¤Èe fell very slowl?, for sh?¨¤had plenty of ti?e as she w?nt down to look about her ao? to wonder what was going t? happen next.
