So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a d?isy-chain would be wo?th the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit sa? to itself, ¡®Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!¡¯ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field!?fter it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop ?own a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, ?ever once considering how in the world she was to get ou? again.The rabbit-hole went!?traight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped s?ddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself?before she found herself falling down a ver? deep well.E?ther the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of ime as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anyth??g; then she loked at the sides of the well, and noticed?that they were filled with&?upboards and book-shelves;??ere and there she saw ma?s a?? pictu?es hung upon pegs. \¤È? took&down a jar from one# the ??elves a she passe?; it wys??abelled ¡®ORANGE ?MR?GLAD????but to her grea???ipa?po	???¤Ånt it was empty???h¤Ý??id?nl??like ti drop the ?a? for8?r of killing sim?b??y? ?o8ma?aged to put it¨ª???o?one of#t¤Èe cupbards as she?f?lc©@??st it.¡®Well!¡¯ thoud????lice?to?herself, ¡®after?su?o?? ?g?a??s this, I shall ?hi?? ?ot??ng of tumbling e?w??p??iBs??H?w brave they¡¯l?????!???n???e at home!
